## Intro

This is a living document that helps others understand how to best interact and work with me. It includes the following:

* **Communication preferences**
* **Work habits and routines**
* **Decision-making**
* **Idiosyncrasies**
* **Pet peeves**

Emphasis on "living". I'm putting this out to the world but know I am--and aim to always be--a work-in-progress.

## Communication preferences

* Email / Slack / Text for communications that can tolerate a few hours delay.
* If its more urgent, call me.
* For issues that require a low-latency back-and-forth, impromptu meeting is preferred.
* Communicate with me collaboratively. I get pig headed when people tell me what to do, or arrogantly assert they know best (although I realise the people that do this probably don‚Äôt realize it themselves!).

### Meetings

* I don‚Äôt chafe at meetings like many. I‚Äôm a fan of high-bandwidth meetings with a clear target. Meetings are great for sharing/ingesting summarized state (e.g. project status), reaching a mutual understanding (even if people disagree with each other), debate, and building rapport.
* Meetings without notetaking are pointless.
* I enjoy brainstorming in group meetings. But from past experience, I‚Äôve found a lot of meeting bandwidth gets consumed in giving people background. If we‚Äôre going to engage in a freestyle discussion, lets come into it ‚Äúwarm‚Äù after doing the pre-work.
* Meetings are NOT a good place to make decisions. If something contentious needs a decision, it‚Äôs best to use a meeting to exchange perspectives, discuss trade-offs, and agree on a timeframe for reaching a decision. Ultimately, the alternatives and tradeoff-analysis should be written down somewhere and someone can use that to make a final call offline (or in a follow-up meeting).

## Work habits and routines

### Daily

* Each day, I usually work from 10 am to 9 pm. Of course, this is not rigid and my social schedule does overlap with my work schedule, once or twice a week.

### Weekly

* I work 6 days a week, Sunday through Friday. I end up working 60-70 hours per week, which I can sustain indefinitely.

### Flex time

* I accept that work is non-linear as a founder so I'm willing to adapt my schedule to pressing demands.
* Saturdays are my flex days, which I usually protect for R&R. Or I'll work at a casual pace or engage in "big picture" thinking. I go by feel. But if needed, I can work through a Saturday.
* Other flex time: One weekend a month, one week a quarter -- Scheduled around milestones / sprints.

### Work-life balance

* My beliefs on this subject are explained [here](https://hardikvala.com/2024/08/19/work-life-harmony.html).
* Working 70+ hours per week means sacrificing those other areas of my life that serve the long-term. These sorts of sprints are expected but difficult to continue for more than a few weeks without addressing the life debt that piles up.

### Style

* I tend to trust people by default to know what they are doing. I do not like to intervene or micromanage ‚Äî unless they ask for help.
* I love to be challenged with different or counter intuitive points of view.

## Decision-making

* Best way to convince me is to convince me that you've explored many alternatives and weighed the trade-offs, and logically arrived at an opinion with honest recognition of the things you don't know.
* I'm decisive when it comes to reversible decisions and contemplative when making decisions that are one-way doors. I prefer some solitude to think through options for the latter kind of decisions before finalizing a choice.

## Idiosyncrasies

* Debate: If meetings are where ideas are shared, I use debate as a critical tool to separate the good ones from the bad ones. I‚Äôm not a very opinionated person but I appreciate how debate can get us to desired outcomes faster. If you see me challenge an idea, it doesn‚Äôt mean I disagree with it or I‚Äôm being negative ‚Äî I‚Äôm just testing its strength.
* Process: I always say, plan beats no plan--even if the plan is wrong. People assume that my compulsion towards process stems from a need for everything to be logical and meticulously defined. Rather, I just like to apply some rigor in establishing goals, specifying strategies, and spotlight what is known and what is unknown‚ÄîAll of which maybe loosely outlined. I believe in being methodical, testing assumptions, and failing fast.

## Pet peeves

* Being micromanaged.
* Complaining without an intention to problem-solve.
* People who lack self-awareness and are not looking to improve.
* I detest having to wait for late arrivals to a meeting. But at the same time, I‚Äôm the least punctual human being. I know, it‚Äôs hypocritical. But please respect my time and don‚Äôt be late to our meeting. I‚Äôll sincerely try to do the same.
