## Intro

When vetting co-founder prospects for my upcoming startup, I measure their potential against a rubric consisting of the 3 Cs:

* Capability: Reflects their aptitude to be a strong founder, agnostic of the team.
* Complementarity: Refers to the knowledge and skill gaps they fill to help form a complete founding team.
* Compatibility: Whether the other person shares your values, garners mutual respect, and is fun to work with. 

Compatibility is the hardest to measure. Startup culture has studied the makeup of capable and skilled founders, ad nauseum. But comparatively less has been written about compatibility. That's not surprising. Compatibility is highly individual, and differs from founder to founder, team to team.

Until I experienced the full cycle of a startup (from birth to death), I had a vague idea of what I value in teammates. But when you're working closely with people, over long hours in a high-pressure environment, you suddenly sharpen your understanding on what qualifies someone as compatible.

In this piece, I'm not going to retread the well-beaten path of discerning the traits of a bonafide founder. Instead, I'll do my best to shed light on the subjective values I believe ***my*** ideal co-founder possesses.

Note: I'm always learning, especially about myself, so treat this as a living document, subject to additions and changes.

## Values

### 1) Growth-Obsessed

This doesn't mean just obsessing about company growth metrics. I'm looking for someone who's maniacal about personal and professional growth in all its forms as well. It's the growth mindset on steroids. The growth-obsessed founder,

* Is constantly on the lookout for new knowledge and skills, even in areas outside their immediate expertise. Pushes themselves and others out of their comfort zones.
* Not only accepts challenges and setbacks as opportunities to learn and improve, but seeks them out.
* Has a voracious appetitie for feedback and constructive criticism.
* Embraces a "beginner's mindset", remaining curious and open to new ideas, no matter where they originate and how far-fetched they may seem at first blush.

This dispoisition meshes well with startups. Startups need to grow to get big and that growth needs to be continual and compounding. During each act of a startup, the growth of the company is limited by the rate of learning of the founders. eg. At the beginning, you need to rapidly learn about your customer and industry to arrive at PMF, after which you'll need to develop proficiency in managing, hiring, fundraising, etc. to scale effectively. At any point, if the startup is idle, it suffers. So growth is what matters.

> ‚ÄúLife is growth. You grow or you die.‚Äù -- Phil Knight.

### 2) Extremely Responsible

I work best when working with other people who are responsible. When they agree to take charge of something (e.g. a task, user journey, customer relationship, OKR), they take full ownership. They make the decisions but they also manage the mistakes and misfortune. They serve as the point of contact, and others on the team can disengage from fielding questions, progress tracking, marshaling resources to achieve that goal. That doesn‚Äôt mean they necessarily do all the work, but they are ultimately ‚Äúon the hook‚Äù for it. 

This doesn't mean fostering a culture with rigid silos of work, so when something goes wrong, its obvious who to blame. When everyone knows how to hold themselves accountable, blaming is pointless. Instead, I like it when people assume a broad scope of responsibility, that includes their core directives but also work they're not directly in charge of. There's an implicit and shared ownership in outcomes across the team so when errors occur or bad fortune strikes, people don't react with guilt, they react by correcting the situation together. They have each other's back.

### 3) High Reflexivity

If startup success is a function of learning rate, then the most important skill needed for growth is reflection. That skill needs to surface through the company stack, from the business to the organization to the individuals in the company. Excavating lessons from wins and losses doesn't happen through osmosis, so people need to put in the effort to unearth actionable takeaways. That's how you eventually attain victory. So I need people who are conscious of the impact they are having on the company and choose to respond emphatically to improving, instead of blindly thrashing around in their own drama and blame.

### 4) Intellectually Honest

**4** **Minimal egoists**: Truth-seeking, especially against a chaotic system like the markets, means managing your preconceptions of right and wrong. Having a ~[small identity](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html)~ is a prerequisite for opening yourself to new learnings. That includes having an inviting and healthy relationship with failure. Failure is the best teacher. So we don't want know-it-alls, we want *learn-it-alls*. There's a great deal of humility that's necessary when the determinant of truth in the outside world that you have no control over. So we keep our ego in check. We don't have to exsize it completely. But direct it in productive ways. Like dismissing attempts to tear down your ambitions that aren't based in logic or evidence. Chasing a unicorn is irrational and so ego is necessary to offset the doubts. But don't let it impede access to new and valuable information.
