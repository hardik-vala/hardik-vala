title: 😵‍💫 The Overthinking Founder
date: 2025-04-09

For the first time ever, someone acquired my product. I did not receive a life-changing amount of money in exchange--no where even close. But it was nice to have built something and have its valued recognized. It's given the chance to live through the full lifecycle of a product--from inception to (micro-)exit, refining my conception of *conviction*.

## There will always be doubt

I used to think conviction meant the complete removal of doubt. Because, well, isn't that the marker of a successful entrepreneur? Someone with a level of unwavering belief in their vision that can only be rivalled by the likes of a Steve Jobs? Because that's table stakes for someone who's a visionary founder. I remember one time when I felt possessed with that kind of absolute conviction. I acted on that belief, racing headlong towards building my vision and...eventually crashed spectacularly. The market didn't care about my vision and my execution was abysmal. That failure left scars...and ever since, I've been disillusioned by unquestioned belief.

Afterwards, as a consequence, I became a staunch skeptic. When I began my search for a new founding idea, I couldn't help but question everything: every hunch, every assumption, every decision. My algorithm for doubt was endlessly looping: *Is the problem worth solving? Is the market big enough? Would anyone actually pay for it? Is this idea venture-scale?* etc. Of course, doubt--when moderated--can be a helpful ally. It can ask the important, guiding questions. It can act as your compass, preventing you from traveling down roads that lead to a dead end, or off a cliff. Having a healthy relationship with your inner doubt prevents you from tipping over into delusion. But in excess, your misgivings can linger over every decision. Overthinking becomes over-protection. Like a parent so afraid of their child getting hurt that they never let them leave the house.

My doubt became my constant companion, but instead of steering me in the right direction, it became the enemy of progress. When I asked myself if I'm enough of an expert to get traction in an industry, I came up with opposing reasons. When I asked myself if this market was big enough, I would conjure numbers to show that it wasn't big enough to support a venture-scale company. In cases where it was big enough, I would conclude that there was too much competition to make a successful entry. With every question and every decision that would allow me to take one step forward, there was a plausible counter-argument for why I shouldn't take that step. I was spinning my wheels under all the relentless questioning.

The dam finally broke when I got fed up with analysis paralysis. I chose to accept that there will always be doubt. That all my choices carried a non-negligible, irreducible risk of turning out bad. So when I was contemplating the product that would eventually get bought, I decided that as long as there was some baseline intuition telling me there was a possibility of success, I would move forward. So when I starting building, doubt was still buzzing in the background. *Is this worth it? Do you really think someone will want this? Am I the right person to make this work?* Doing my best impression of practiced meditator, I let these thoughts come and go, letting them chip away at my confidence--Instead of acting on them or fighting.

I persevered through the nagging presence of my reservations--from ideation to sale. At times, it sharpened my focus instead of being a hindrance. Anyways, I'm glad I got something valuable from the whole experience: Not the pittance of a financial reward, but the proof that I can succeed despite the ambient self-doubt.

> Having many founders going -1 to 0, I've found this disease is quite common. Armmed with mental models and analytical tools, founders convince themselves out of pursueing anything. That's why you need something else to pull you through the  

* This is a common refrain I hear from early-stage founders: "Once I stopped thinking like an investor, I started to make progress".
* Investors have a toolkit of mental models and what not to dissect startup ideas, which serves them well, but when you apply the same tools, you can talk yourself out of pursuing anything.

* A shadow that lingered over every decision.
* But here’s the thing I’ve come to realize: doubt isn’t the enemy of conviction—it’s part of it.
* True conviction isn’t blind faith; it’s the courage to move forward despite the uncertainty, to act even when the outcome isn’t guaranteed.
* That first product sale taught me this. It wasn’t a massive win, but it was proof that progress doesn’t demand perfection—it demands persistence.
* Doubt will always be there, whispering in the background, but I’ve learned to let it tag along without letting it steer the ship.

## Conclusion

What I’ve come to realize is that doubt isn’t something to conquer—it’s a fixture, a constant companion on the road of building anything meaningful. It’s there when you start, it’s there when you finish, and it’s there even after you let go. But those scars from my earlier failure taught me something vital: doubt doesn’t have to paralyze you. It can sharpen your focus, force you to question, and push you to refine what you’re creating. The real trick is balance—not silencing doubt, but not letting it spiral into overthinking either.

Selling my product, modest as the outcome was, redefined conviction for me. It’s not about erasing doubt or pretending it doesn’t exist. It’s about moving forward with it in tow, acknowledging its presence, and acting anyway. That first sale didn’t kill the questions—it showed me I could carry them and still find a way through. Doubt will always be there, but it’s the choice to keep going that turns it from a burden into a guide.

* I imagined that true belief in an idea would silence the inner critic, banish the what-ifs, and propel me toward success with unwavering confidence.
* That experience flipped my understanding upside down. Absolute conviction isn’t the absence of doubt; it’s a refusal to see it—a kind of reckless tunnel vision that mistakes certainty for strength.
* And yet, the doubts didn’t disappear. They shifted: Should I have held out? What’s next? Can I repeat this?
