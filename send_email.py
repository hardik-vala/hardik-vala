            <p>Hey,</p>

            <p>I'm emailing you from a different email to automate sending. Up until now, I've been sending each email manually. It's less personal, but I need to rescue some of my time from toil.</p>
            
            <p>Here's my new essay: <a href="{LINK}">{SUBJECT}</a>.</p>

            <p>You're receiving this because you made the poor decision to join my inner circle. But thanks for being a part of it.</p>

            <p>Onward and upward,</p>

            <p>Hardik</p>
