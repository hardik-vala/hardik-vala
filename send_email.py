            <p>Hey,</p>

            <p>It's been a while. My latest post contains a short life update: <a href="{LINK}">{SUBJECT}</a>.</p>

            <p>You're receiving this because you made the poor decision to join my inner circle. But thanks for being a part of it.</p>

            <p>Onward and upward,</p>
