## tl;dr

## Intro

![98% of startups fail...so you're telling me there's a chance](https://i.imgflip.com/8zdix1.jpg)

The statistics on the success vs. failure rate of startups paint a *brutal* picture. We can bicker about the precision in the numbers, but its no secret that the vast majority of startups fail. More than 99.9% never reach unicorn status and over 90% never get to profitably. Even the median YC startup is dead. And when you acknowledge how hard and demanding a startup can be for founders over a prolonged period of time, you're better off doing almost anything else, on a risk-adjusted basis. If you're seeking impact, fame, wealth, adventure, etc., I tell aspiring founders that you're better off satisfying those needs elsewhere. The sacrifices and tribulations of founder life aren't worth it. 

With such bleak odds, you have to be stupid to be a founder. And what I mean by that is your rationale must transcend superficial logic. Because an intelligent person can crunch the probabilties and expected upside to quickly determine that it doesn't make mathematical sense to start a startup. You either have to be clinically insane, where your brain can't reconcile the unfavorable odds, or rely on powerful motivations rooted deep in your psychology. 

Entrepreneurs flock to the startup game in droves, and most of them are probably not suffering from brain damage. So they must be driven by some mighty internal forces. Well, at least those that aren't weeded out by the enormity of the challenge. Many file into startups because its fashionable or see it as a way to get-rich-quick, but in my experience, those people don't survive. I've met 100s of founders and I've attempted to psychoanalysis their drivers--as well as my own. Words like "impact" and "freedom", and "wearing many hats", are consistent in many explanations. But I believe that disguises a more foundational story. Again, because I think you can fulfill those values without building a startup, with way less headache.

In this piece, I attempt to peel back many layers of psychology to examine the core motives behind founding a startup, with a focus on my own. I'm going to tell this story in 5 parts:

* Self-Importance: The fundamental human urge to be important and be recognized.
* Startups: How startups offer people the greatest self-importance. 
* Duty: The obligation to fully saturate your potential for significance.
* Conditions: The optimal conditions for achieving that significance through self-actualization.
* Hope: The role of hope.

## Self-Importance

Sigmund Freud, one of the pioneers of modern psychology, said that everything we do springs from two motives: sex and the desire to be great. Much of civilization would've been impossible if our ancestors didn't have this burning desire for a feeling of importance. This feeling inspired Charles Dickens to write his immortal novels. It inspired Amelia Earhart to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. It made Marie Curie conduct groundbreaking, extremely dangerous, and eventually life-threatening research on radioactivity.

Doing significant and impactful work, and receiving recognition for it, is part and parcel of the human condition. We want to offer unique value that makes a difference. Inside of large corporations, this is generally graded under "impact" on performance reviews. In terms of Tony Robbins' [6 human needs](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/blog/do-you-need-to-feel-significant), you can think of self-importance as a combination of Significance and Contribution.

Many of us are fueled by this hard-wired need for self-importance, and try to fulfill it to varying degrees. We all don't need to act on this urge or achieve it through some humanity-scale ambition. Many people are content to find significance in their local communities, families, or more modest career achievements. But I believe what drives many people, myself included, to seek foundership, beyond the shallow rewards of wealth and power, is a pathological need to ascend to an elite standing in the world.

## Startups

High-growth start-ups are a miracle of free market capitalism. We take it for granted, but when you step back, its hard not to appreciate how extraordinay today's startup ecosystem is, especially when you consider the history of modern economies. The fact that we can exponentially grow businesses to huge scales is only possible through a symphony of market forces: A healthy supply of risk-seeking venture-capital financing, mature mechanisms for capital allocation, scaffolding for building products and distributing them at ever-decreasing costs, widespread startup knowledge, large and robust markets to serve--to name a few--all while creating a rising tide on the quality of life. And of course, there's the most important ingredient: Ambitious and risk-taking founders.

That's why the majority of the top fortunes in the world belong to founders. Compare that to 1982 where 60% of those fortunes were inherited from a relative. Wealth is not a great proxy, but the best proxy we have, at measuring up the importance of an individual (I know, the world sucks). So its no surprise that people are rushing to become founders. There's very little besides startups that offer the same value creation and importance capture potential. You get to leverage your abilities to choose a high-value problem in the world that improves the lives of potentially millions, and reap the remarkable financial and social rewards. Nothing else--like becoming a doctor, CXO, or restaurant owner--really compares.

So if you're uncomprisming in your quest for the greatest feeling of greatness, startups are the best vehicle for that.

## Duty

When I got the offer to work at Apple, I thought I reached my career's final destination. Having lived my whole life in the frigid and desolate suburbs of Ottawa (Canada), the chance to work at the world's leading technology company at the heart of Silicon Valley, surrounded by world-class talent, felt like a dream fulfilled. I couldn't imagine any better way to use my knowledge and skills to contribute to the world. And I honestly believed I would work there forever.

Then something unexpected happened. At Apple, I worked with a lot of exceptionally smart, driven, and hard-working people but over time, their extraordinary-ness faded. It no longer felt foreign and unattainable. I started to believe if they could climb to certain heights, so could I. So my ambition grew. And when I joined Google and got exposure to a premier engineering culture, once again the ceiling of my perceived potential rose. Then I got accepted into YC and it was deja vu. One of the underrated benefits of YC is the opportunity to meet your idols--legendary YC founders like Brian Chesky, Tony Xu, and Christina Cacioppo--up close and personal. In addition to high-profile rising stars in technology, names you'd see on acclaimed lists like Forbes 30u30. But once again, I became disillusioned. Socializing with these people made me realize they weren't all that different from you and I. Access to brilliance made brilliance more accessible. So finally, I gave myself permission to expand my ambition 10-fold. If they could do it...so could I.

Knowing this truth now--that I have the potential to succeed at a startup--I find it hard to ignore. Many people play it safe and choose not to act on their full potential and that is ok. I can't fully explain its origins, but I have this ingrained sense of *duty* that impels me to actualize all that untapped potential. It's an obligation that I can't simply discharge. And I bet I'm not alone. I see it as a rare privilege: To have been gifted this awareness of my capacity to be great, and I owe it to manifest it. And the only place that can effectuate all that ambition, is through startups. Therefore, I have a duty to be a founder.

## Conditions

## Hope

I'm going to conclude with a coda on hope.

As a startup founder, grasping for the highest significance and designing your life to improve your chances doesn't mean success is guaranteed. We routinely underestimate the relative contribution of luck. So even though we founders may feel obligated to beat the odds with a purity of conviction in ourselves, the chances are still disturbingly low. So how do we persevere and not buckle under the weight of such discouraging risk? I think the answer is hope.

I often think about lotteries, and why people buy tickets despite the comically low probability that they'll actually win a sizable sum of money. The over-simplified explanation is that its simply a tax on the poor and statistically illiterate. But I think it overlooks an invisible exchange of intangible goods. When people buy a lottery ticket, I believe what they receive immediately in return is hope. Hope that one day, with the help of untold riches, they'll live the dream life they've always wanted. They may not see a road to that life otherwise. They are purchasing hope for that better life.

Startups are not like lotteries. The probabilities here are much less lopsided. But there's a vital lesson to be gleaned. I think what justifies this seemingly irrational pursuit is the morcel of faith that one day, we might achieve the highest self-importance. And that we will be respected by all. That's the covenant we agree to each day as a founder: We trade sweat for hope.
