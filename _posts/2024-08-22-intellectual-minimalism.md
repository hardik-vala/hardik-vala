## Intro

People get frustrated when they ask me about my opinion about something. *Do you think AI is going to eliminate all software engineering jobs?* *What's your stance on the loosening of immigration policy in Canada?* *Is the dress blue and black, or white and gold?* Most of the time, my answer is, "I don't know" (For the last question, it's white and gold. You're visually impaired otherwise). Actually, I respond with questions. Question that come from the awareness that I'm probably not informed enough to have an opinion. Whether its about speculating on the impact of emerging technologies, current political issues, or a viral cultural debate, I keep my opinions and beliefs to minimum. 

Between our ears sits a biological neural network with 80-90 billion parameters, a number that's relatively stable for each of us throughout our lives. Connections between neurons are fluid but for the most part, our cognitive capacity is constant. So I curate the information I allow into my network. Consequently, I try and minimize the number of opinions I store. Put another way, I have a limited budget for how many fucks I can give, so I try and choose only the fucks that matter most.

With this piece, I'm going to try to explain the design choices to my internal belief architecture. It's based on a philosophy of minimalism that has helped me cultivate focus, control my information intake, and reduce mental clutter. As a byproduct, I believe I'm just a more curious, open-minded, and intellectually humble person.
