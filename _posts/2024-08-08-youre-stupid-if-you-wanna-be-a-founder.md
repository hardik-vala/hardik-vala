## tl;dr

## Intro

![98% of startups fail...so you're telling me there's a chance](https://i.imgflip.com/8zdix1.jpg)

The statistics on the success vs. failure rate of startups paint a *brutal* picture. We can bicker about the precision in the numbers, but its no secret that the vast majority of startups fail. More than 99.9% never reach unicorn status and over 90% never get to profitably. Even the median YC startup is dead. And when you acknowledge how hard and demanding a startup can be for founders over a prolonged period of time, you're better off doing almost anything else, on a risk-adjusted basis. If you're seeking impact, fame, wealth, adventure, etc., I tell aspiring founders that you're better off satisfying those needs elsewhere. The sacrifices and tribulations of founder life aren't worth it. 

With such bleak odds, you have to be stupid to be a founder. And what I mean by that is your rationale must transcend superficial logic. Because an intelligent person can crunch the probabilties and expected upside to quickly determine that it doesn't make mathematical sense to start a startup. You either have to be clinically insane, where your brain can't reconcile the unfavorable odds, or rely on powerful motivations rooted deep in your psychology. 

Yet, entrepreneurs flock to the startup game in droves, and most of them are probably not suffering from brain damage. So they must be driven by some mighty internal drivers. Well, at least those that aren't weeded out by the enormity of the challenge. Many file into startups because its fashionable or see it as a way to get-rich-quick, but in my experience, those people don't survive. I've met hundreds of founders and I've attempted to analyze their drivers--as well as my own. Words like "impact" and "freedom", and "wearing many hats", are consistent in many explanations. But I believe that disguises a more foundational story. Again, because I think you can fulfill those values without building a startup, with way less headache.

In this piece, I attempt to peel back many layers of psychology to examine the core motives behind founding a startup, with a focus on my own. I'm going to tell this story in 5 parts:

* Self-Importance: The fundamental human urge to be important and be recognized.
* Startups: How startups offer people a chance for the most self-importance. 
* Duty: The obligation to fully saturate your potential for significance.
* Conditions: The optimal conditions for achieving that significance through self-actualization.
* Hope: The role of hope.

## Self-Importance

Sigmund Freud, one of the pioneers of modern psychology, said that everything we do springs from two motives: sex and the desire to be great. Much of civilization would've been impossible if our ancestors didn't have this burning desire for a feeling of importance. This feeling inspired Charles Dickens to write his immortal novels. It inspired Amelia Earhart to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. It made Marie Curie conduct groundbreaking, extremely dangerous, and eventually life-threatening research on radioactivity.

Doing significant and impactful work, and receiving recognition for it, is part and parcel of the human condition. We want to offer unique value that makes a difference. Inside of large corporations, this is generally graded under "impact" on performance reviews. In terms of Tony Robbins' [6 human needs](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/blog/do-you-need-to-feel-significant), you can think of self-importance as a combination of Significance and Contribution.

Many of us are fueled by this hard-wired need for self-importance, and try to fulfill it to varying degrees. We all don't need to act on this urge or achieve it through some humanity-scale ambition. Many people are content to find significance in their local communities, families, or more modest career achievements. But I believe what drives many people, myself included, to seek foundership, beyond the shallow rewards of wealth and power, is a pathological need to ascend to the pinnacle of greatness.

## Startups

High-growth start-ups are a miracle of free market capitalism. We take it for granted, but when you step back, its hard not to appreciate how extraordinay today's startup ecosystem is, especially when you consider the evolution of modern economies. The fact that we can exponentially grow businesses to huge scales is only possible through a delicate symphony of behavioral and market forces: A healthy supply of risk-seeking venture-capital financing, mature mechanisms for capital allocation, scaffolding for building products and distributing them at ever-decreasing costs, widespread startup knowledge, an idolatry of founder-led companies, large and robust markets to serve--to name a few--all while creating a rising tide on the quality of life. And of course, there's the most important ingredient: Ambitious, crazy, risk-taking founders.

That's why the majority of the top fortunes in the world belong to founders. Compare that to 1982 where 60% of those fortunes were inherited from a relative. Wealth is not a great proxy, but the best proxy we use, at measuring up the importance of an individual in society (I know, the world sucks). So its no surprise that people are rushing to become founders. There's very little besides startups that offer the same value creation and importance capture potential. You get to leverage your abilities to choose a high-value problem in the world that improves the lives of potentially millions, and reap the remarkable financial and social rewards. Nothing else--like becoming a doctor, CXO, or restaurant owner--really compares.

So if you're uncomprimising in your quest for the greatest feeling of greatness, startups are the best vehicle for that.

## Duty

When I got the offer to work at Apple, I thought I reached my career's final destination. Having lived my whole life in the frigid and desolate suburbs of Ottawa, Canada, the chance to work at the world's leading technology company at the heart of Silicon Valley, surrounded by world-class talent, felt like a dream fulfilled. I couldn't imagine any better way to use my knowledge and skills to contribute to the world, and I honestly believed I would work there forever.

Then something unexpected happened. At Apple, I worked with a lot of exceptionally smart, driven, and hard-working people, but over time, their extraordinary-ness faded. It no longer felt foreign and unattainable. I started to believe if they could climb to certain heights, so could I. So I let my ambition grow. And when I joined Google and got exposure to a different level of engineering brilliance, once again the ceiling of my perceived potential rose. Then I got accepted into YC and it was deja vu. One of the underrated benefits of YC is the opportunity to meet your idols--legendary YC founders like Brian Chesky, Tony Xu, and Christina Cacioppo--up close and personal. In addition to high-profile rising stars in technology, names you'd see on acclaimed lists like Forbes 30u30. But once again, I became disillusioned. Socializing with these people made me realize they weren't all that different from you and I. Access to greatness made greatness feel more accessible. So finally, I gave myself permission to expand my ambition thousand-fold. If they could succeed with a startup, so could I.

Knowing this truth now, I find it hard to ignore. Many people play it safe and choose not to act on their full potential and that's ok. I can't fully explain it, but my soul rejects that idea like an 18th century organ transplant. I have this ingrained sense of *duty* that compels me to exercise all that untapped potential. It's an existential obligation that I haven't been able to discharge. And I bet I'm not alone (a common theme among entrepreneurs I know is the *regret* they would feel if they didn't take shot at startups). Now I see it as a rare privilege: To have been gifted this awareness of my capacity to be great, I owe it to manifest it. And the only outlet for all that ambition, is startups. Ergo, its my duty to be a founder.

## Conditions

For me, there's a unique dual-proposition behind startups: It not only gives me the opportunity to do the most good for the most recognition, it also offers me the conditions to produce my best work. Lets step through each of those 8 conditions.

### 1) Growth

There's nothing that will test you more, intellectually and emotionally, than pursuing a startup. It's so damn hard. And the distress is constant. It's not something you experience in short bursts (although there are ups and downs). I relish that. Even though I'm amazed by my personal and professional growth in the 7 years I spent as a tech worker, it doesn't compare to the accelerated development I experienced in the nearly 2 years as a founder. When you remove the structure and support of a large organization around you, you're naked to the ruthlessness of markets. I don't want to needlessly attack the 9-5 (which has virtuous qualities), but the truth is, you can succeed as an employee if you're in the ~75th percentile of the labor market for your profession. But as a startup founder, if you're not in the 95th percentile, you will fail. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of luck involved, but along the skill distribution, you need to exist at least two standard deviations to the right to have a shot at making it. That's because you need to learn so many skills (eg. sales, hiring, product) and gather so many customer insights at a rapid pace, otherwise you'll lose runway or be out-competed. This will naturally force you to continuously push yourself outside your comfort zone. I love that challenge. I'm a learning addict. And like a shark that must swim to live, if I don't grow, I will die. 

### 2) Autonomy

So...I'm a bit of a maverick. Just ask some of my former managers. I do things without instruction or permission all the time. And that's the alluring thing about entrepreneurship for many: Not only does it tolerate rebellious behavior, it rewards it. I know I do my most innovative work when I have room to maneuver creatively, without the weight of corporate bureaucracy. As the captain of my own ship, sometimes I make bad decisions, but I need that freedom to express my talents and test my limits in order to maximize my successful outputs. And that agency to make decisions is an essential ingredient for my own self-actualization.

Autonomy is also attractive because it begets authenticity. As a founder, you choose which problem to solve and how to solve it, you build the company's culture from the ground up, you set the vision and strategy, etc.--All in a way that's authentic to you. There are work environments out there that people can plug themselves into to fully expressing themselves, but for founders like me, I've yet to find that environment outside of my own company that doesn't make me chafe. 

Of course, with great autonomy comes great responsibility. The flip side of this freedom is that the buck stops with you. Every decision, every success, and every failure ultimately rests on your shoulders. That can expose you to a different set of imposing factors. But I'm willing to make that trade-off for control over my professional destiny and work environment.

### 3) Wealth

Earlier, I alluded to the potential of startups to offer a sense of tremendous worth from the gains in personal wealth. But the unparalleled financial rewards can also be a huge unlock for a founder. They get so much financial freedom which opens doors to pursue other passions, support causes they care about, provide security for their family, etc. 

For me, it's less about luxury and status, and more about optionality and impact (note to self: remember this line in 10 years when you're shopping for a BMW i8 roadster). Having financial resources allows you to take bigger swings, fund ambitious projects, and potentially do even more good in the world. The way I see it, it's a means to an end, not the end itself.

Also, there's something uniquely satisfying about building wealth through value creation. When a startup succeeds financially, it's because you've created something of value for customers and society. The wealth is a byproduct of that impact.

However, the vast majority of founders don't strike it rich, and many end up worse off financially than if they had stable jobs. The wealth potential comes with enormous risk. But I can't deny that its pretty effective motivator.

### 4) Mimetic Desire

While I'm writing this essay in San Francisco, the Mecca of startups, I have to admit that this incliniation I possess is something I've absorbed from the people around me.

Mimetic desire is an academic concept that suggests that our desires are not our own but are copied from others. In Silicon Valley, this phenomenon is particularly potent. We see successful founders and unconsciously model our ambitions after theirs.

I can't deny that mimetic desire impacts me. I'm situated inside a tech hub where culturally, entrepreneurship is the norm, not the exception. Within my immediate circle, I've witnessed friends and former colleagues take the startup leap. When you're surrounded by people building ambitious projects, it's hard not to catch the bug yourself.

The prevalent desire to successfully exit a startup is partly why it confers so much prestige and importance. The fact that so many people are grasping for it, and because its hard to get, its exceptionally valuable. 

### 5) Belonging

![Is the cure to male loneliness building B2B SaaS with the homies?](/assets/images/cure_to_male_loneliness_b2b_saas_with_homies.jpg)

When I first stumbled onto this meme, I laughed incessantly. Because it rings so true!

When you ask military veterans what they miss about service, a lot of them will tell you its the camaraderie. They say there's nothing in civilian life that can emulate the close bonds they formed with their fellow service members. Some return to active duty just to experience the same level of belonging.

Startups pale in comparison to the difficulty and stakes of military duty. But there's some resemblance. When you're trying to will the growth of your startup, everyday feels like a battle. And the only way you get through each day is with the help and support of co-founders and a wider community of fellow founders, who share the same experiences, purpose, culture, and values. Nobody else can really empathize with what life is like in the trenches, and there often isn't anybody else you can rely on.

Some of my most cherished relationships have been forged in the fires of building companies. And I can't think of a better community that gives me a sense of acceptance and belonging. The familial closeness gives me a foundation to work hard on my startup everyday, and take bold risks.

### 6) Adventure

### 7) Underdog

Looking back through my career, I had to be an underdog first to breed the hunger I needed to eventually excel.

* I failed my first ever college course in computer programming so I decided to major in CS and graduate in the top 10% of my class.
* I flubbed my first university research project so I decided to enrol in graduate studies in NLP and ended up publishing at tier-1 conferences.
* I tanked all of my first FAANG interviews, so I became an ML engineer at Apple. Then an ML engineer at Google.
* At Google, my incubator project was cancelled, and my team was fired, so I launched my first startup in 2023 and got accepted into YC.

I'm the type of person who can work at peak capacity only after suffering some setbacks. When people around me doubt I can actually win. There's a deep satisfication that comes from proving my chief haters--and myself--wrong about my presumed limits.

My [YC startup](https://hardikvala.com/2024/07/08/my-first-startup-the-post-mortem.html) went bust after the batch ended, and that has gifted me a big chip on my shoulder. If history is any indication, it means I'm now destined to succeed.

### 8) Pain

## Hope

I'm going to conclude with a coda on hope.

As a startup founder, grasping for the highest significance and designing your life to improve your chances doesn't mean success is guaranteed. We routinely underestimate the relative contribution of luck. So even though we founders may feel obligated to beat the odds with a purity of conviction in ourselves, the chances are still disturbingly low. So how do we persevere and not buckle under the weight of such discouraging risk? I think the answer is hope.

I often think about lotteries, and why people buy tickets despite the comically low probability that they'll actually win a sizable sum of money. The over-simplified explanation is that its simply a tax on the poor and statistically illiterate. But I think it overlooks an invisible exchange of intangible goods. When people buy a lottery ticket, I believe what they receive immediately in return is hope. Hope that one day, with the help of untold riches, they'll live the dream life they've always wanted. They may not see a road to that life otherwise. They are purchasing hope for that better life.

Startups are not like lotteries. The probabilities here are much less lopsided. But there's a vital lesson to be gleaned. I think what justifies this seemingly irrational pursuit is the morcel of faith that one day, we might achieve the highest self-importance. And that we will be respected by all. That's the covenant we agree to each day as a founder: We trade sweat for hope.
