## Intro

People get frustrated when they ask me about my opinion about something because the majority of the time, I don't have an opinion to share. 

*Do you think Canada's immigration policy is too lenient?*
*What year do you think we'll achieve AGI?*
*Who do you think is better, Lebron or Kobe?*
*Is the dress blue and black, or white and gold?* (I guess I do have an opinion here: white and gold)...

Most of the time, my answer is, "I don't know". Well actually, I respond with questions. I'm under-informed about a vast array of topics so I ask questions to learn. But whether its about speculating on current political issues, the impact of emerging technologies, or pop culture debates, I keep my opinions and beliefs to a minimum. 

Between our ears sits a biological neural network with 80-90 billion parameters, a number that's relatively stable for each of us throughout our lives. Connections between neurons are fluid but for the most part, our cognitive capacity is constant. So I carefully curate the information I allow into my network, and what eventually gets stored. Otherwise, I suffer from cognitive and emotional dysfunction from caring about too many things. To put it bluntly, I have a limited budget for how many fucks I can give, so I try to allocate my fucks to what matters most (to me).

With this piece, I'm going to explain the design choices underlying my belief architecture: How I select things that matter, and form beliefs about them. It's based on a philosophy of minimalism that has helped me control my information intake, reduce mental clutter, and cultivate focus.
