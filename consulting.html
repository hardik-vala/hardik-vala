<h1>O-1A Coaching</h1>

<div class="consulting-container">
  <p>I help immigrants working in tech obtain an O-1A visa so they can live in the US while enjoying professional
    freedom, without having to be bound to an employer.</p>

  <p>However, I'm not an immigration lawyer. Nor do I replace one. <i>So how am I useful?</i></p>

  <p>When you engage with a
    lawyer, they will help you with the legal aspects, like drafting and filing an application for a visa. I
    <i>complement</i> a lawyer's services by helping with <b>career strategy and tactics</b>, as far as one year before
    you even start a visa petition. You can always consult an immigration professional to benchmark yourself against the
    requirements for something like the O-1A visa (that'll usually cost some $$$), but you won't get good career advice
    on how you can make further professional progress to best meet the requisite standards. That's where I come in. My
    career has spanned more than a decade in the tech industry (man, that makes me feel old), most of it as a US alien
    under multiple visas. So I'm well-versed in making a career in tech while navigating the US immigration labyrinth.
  </p>

  <h2>My Story</h2>

  <p>At the end of 2023, my startup shuttered its doors and I didn't have a plan for what was next. The
    startup, based in the US, sponsored my work visa, which became void as soon as the company ceased to exist. So my
    immediate priority was to secure another US visa, otherwise I would have to uproot my life in the bay area. At that
    point, I was addicted to the founder life and I really didn't want to return to being an employee. I decided to
    apply for an O-1A visa. It's reserved for individuals of “extraordinary ability” with certain standards of
    excellence you must meet to qualify. I was intimidated. And I was not confident about my chances. But it was the
    best path that supported self-petitioning while not having a clear idea of my next business venture. So within the
    span of a few months, I raced to mount the best case I could, gathering as much evidence as possible to prove I was
    “extraordinary”. Thankfully, in the spring of 2024, the effort paid off and I received my O-1A visa.</p>

  <p>Since then, I've been coaching other immigrants working in tech through career transitions, with a specialty in
    preparing and applying for an O-1A visa.</p>

  <blockquote>"The O-1 was always intimidating to me but thanks to Hardik's encouragement, I summoned the confidence to
    pursue it. Even though I was working with lawyers, Hardik helped me disambiguate the exact preparation steps, and he
    also helped me highlight my accomplishments to build the strongest case. I couldn't have secured an O-1 without
    Hardik's support."

  <h2>FAQ</h2>

  <div class="faq-container">
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">What's the O-1A visa?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>The O-1A visa is for individuals who can show that they have extraordinary ability in the sciences, education
          or business. For the US government, this means having "a level of expertise indicating that the person is one
          of the small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field of endeavor." (As a rule of thumb, you're
          likely eligible if you're in the 90th percentile of your domain.) For the US immigration officers who review
          applications, this means providing evidence of "sustained national or international acclaim and recognition
          for achievements in the field of expertise."</p>

        <p>Practically speaking, in order to obtain an O-1A visa, you will need to prove that you meet at least three of
          the following eight criteria:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>High Salary: Command of a high salary or remuneration relative to others in the field.</li>
          <li>Awards/Prizes: Receipt of nationally or internationally recognized prizes/awards for excellence.</li>
          <li>Membership: Membership in professional associations requiring outstanding achievements for entry.</li>
          <li>Publications: Published material about you in professional/major trade publications or media.</li>
          <li>Judging: Participation as a judge of others' work in the same or similar field.</li>
          <li>Original Contributions: Original scientific, scholarly, or business-related contributions of major
            significance.</li>
          <li>Scholarly Articles: Authorship of scholarly articles in professional journals or major media.</li>
          <li>Critical Employment Capacity: Employment in a critical or essential capacity at distinguished
            organizations.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>However, individuals who have won (or in some cases been nominated for) a major international award of the
          caliber of the Nobel Prize are able to rely on that award alone to obtain an O-1A visa. (I'm going to assume
          this doesn't apply to you.)</p>

        <p>Although the criteria seems indimidating (it did for me), satisfying many of them is actually more
          feasible than you think (C'mon, I was able to do it).</p>

        <p>The best part about the O-1A visa is that you don't need employer sponsorship--You can self-sponsor. That's
          why it's a solution for many immigrants in STEM or business who want to found a startup, build a lifestyle
          business, or
          simply take a career break to explore professionally.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">How can you help me?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>I can help you answer the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><i>I want to continue living and working in the US, but I don't know which visa is best for me. What are
              my options? Is the O-1A the best option?</i></li>
          <li><i>Am I elgibile for the O-1A visa?</i></li>
          <li><i>How can I plan my career so that I can be eligible for the O-1A visa? Where do I start?</i></li>
          <li><i>Given my situation, do you know trustworthy and experienced lawyers that can help me?</i></li>
          <li><i>What can I expect when working with a lawyer to file a petition for my O-1A visa? How should I engage
              with
              them? How can I avoid missteps?</i></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">Why do I need your help?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Frankly, you don't. I was able to successfully obtain an O-1A visa without a coach. You probably can too.</p>

        <p>But without an experienced and trusted guide:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>I was tactically blind.</b> I needed to gather more professional credentials for a stronger case, but I
            didn't know how. I I also didn't always anticipate the steps in assembling a case, even though I had lawyers
            guiding me. As a result, there was trial and error that wasted effort, added stress, and prolonged my
            timeline.</li>
          <li><b>I could've been better prepared.</b> Even though I got the visa in the end, my application had a wide
            margin
            for rejection. There's so I much I wish I'd done in my career to improve my odds (like becoming a member in
            esteemed
            professional organizations) if only I started preparing for my O-1A application 1 year---or even 6
            months---before
            contacting an immigration firm.</li>
          <li><b>I had to educate my lawyers while they were educating me.</b> There was a <i>language</i> barrier
            between me
            and my lawyers: I didn't have a grasp of the immigration nuances (it's much better now) and my lawyers
            didn't have a grasp of my technical context. This caused a lot of back-and-forth that added further delays.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>I can't promise that you won't encounter speed bumps if you hire me, but I'd like to think I can help you
          follow a smoother path.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">How are you different from a lawyer?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Let me state that I'm NOT a substitute for an immigration attorney. Nothing I say should ever be
          constituted as legal advice.</p>

        <p>When you hire an immigration lawyer, they handle the legal aspects of your application, such as drafting and
          filing your petition, interpreting immigration laws, and ensuring compliance with USCIS requirements.
          Attorneys are essential for the formal legal process.</p>

        <p>Me, on the other hand, I focus on helping you navigate the areas where attorneys typically don't
          offer assistance. This includes:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Offering career coaching, well before you're ready to engage with an immigration firm, to enhance your
            eligibility for the O-1A visa.</li>
          <li>Helping you gather evidence, such as identifying awards, memberships, publications, or judging
            opportunities that strengthen your case. It's hard to accomplish any of this in a few months while working
            with a lawyer.</li>
          <li>Guiding you on how to present your achievements effectively to attorneys or in your petition.</li>
          <li>Bridging the gap between your technical expertise and the legal nuances of the visa application process.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>In essence, I help you prepare and strategize <i>before</i> you start the application process, as far as 1
          year out. Think of me as a guide for the practical and tactical aspects leading up to an application, while
          your attorney handles the application itself.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">What qualifies you to be a coach?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Not my non-existent certifications. I'm not a legal professional and cannot provide legal advice. But here's
          what makes me credible:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Lived Experience: I've gone from 0 to approved O-1A and gained a lot of firsthand knowledge from the
            journey. This gives me a perspective that many immigration attorneys or consultants lack---I've been in your
            shoes. I know how overwhelming it can feel to meet the O-1A visa's "extraordinary ability" requirements.
            I've navigated the complexities of gathering evidence, building a strong case, and communicating my
            achievements effectively. Also, prior to the O-1A visa, I've rotated through TN and H-1B visas, overcoming a
            series of challenges along the way.</li>
          <li><b>Proven Results:</b> After obtaining my own O-1A visa, I've helped other immigrants orient their
            careers. Some of them have successfully acquired an O-1A visa thanks to my help. Others are still in the
            middle of their individual journeys.</li>
          <li><b>Tech Career:</b> I understand the unique challenges faced by software professionals that are also US
            aliens because I come from the same background. That's why I've chosen to work exclusively with tech
            workers.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">Who do you work with?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">As an adult, I've only worked in the software industry, so I'm best positioned to help
        immigrants from the same industry.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">I'm not interested in the O-1A visa. Can you still help me?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Yes, but I don't think you'll get the full value of your time and money. I can provide
        some guidance for H-1B and TN visa applications and I don't have firsthand experience with other visas or green
        card petitions.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">Why do you charge for your time?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Because my time is valuable. And I like making money. Also, charging for my time ensures
        that I commit my attention to the individuals I work with. It also reflects your commitment to taking
        this process seriously.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">Why are your prices so low?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">While I charge for my time, I'm not really motivated by profit. This is not what pays my
        bills. I've been in your shoes and know how valuable guidance can be when the stakes are high.
        Even though I was left to my own devices to figure many things out, there were people along the way that kindly
        offered their help with no expectation the favor be returned. This is my way of paying their generosity forward.
